This application is version 1.0 of my language learning app, The Social Language Experiment. I have constructed both the front-end and back-end of this application. Version 1.0 of this app is set up for users to create index cards to expand their vocabulary. When the user hears a word they are not familiar with or find themselves in a situation where they need to say a word, but cannot think of the target language equivalent, they can jump into this app and add the word to their list of index cards. The user can add a definition, pronunciation, sentence and comfort level. After the card is created the user can then search for the card, update the card or delete the card once it has transitioned to their working lexicon. The goals for this application's future extends more into the realm of social language education, but version 1.0 will be focused on gaining new vocabulary that students actually want to learn. This repository displays all of the back-end work I completed for this project and shows how the server was built.
